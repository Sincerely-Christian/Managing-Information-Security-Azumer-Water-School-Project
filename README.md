# 🧱 Managing Information Security – Azumer Water Case

## 📘 Overview
This school project analyzes vulnerabilities and information security management issues in the Azumer Water case study. It focuses on identifying security weaknesses, assessing CIA triad compromises, ensuring compliance with FISMA, and applying NIST and ISO standards to recommend appropriate technical and administrative controls.

## 🎯 Objective
To evaluate real-world cybersecurity risks within an organization and develop a mitigation and compliance strategy aligned with federal security standards.

## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Risk management and threat assessment
- Policy and compliance evaluation (FISMA, NIST SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-122)
- CIA triad analysis (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Development of incident response and technical control plans
- Security program and role structure design

## 🧰 Tools & Frameworks
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5  
- NIST SP 800-122  
- ISO/IEC 27002:2022  
- FISMA (44 U.S.C. § 3551–3554)

## 🔍 Summary of Findings
- Identified vulnerabilities due to outdated **WEP protocol** and **poor employee security awareness**.
- Determined **PII exposure**, data corruption, and service unavailability due to weak controls.
- Recommended upgrading to **WPA3**, enforcing **firewall configurations**, and developing **formal information security programs**.
- Proposed an **organizational structure** with IT, ISO, and Incident Response roles for improved accountability.
